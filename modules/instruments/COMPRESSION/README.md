# Compression Lens

> *What survives compression is structure. What vanishes was noise.*

The Compression Lens reframes inquiry by asking not whether a system works, but **what remains invariant when description length is reduced**.

This instrument is orthogonal to Orbit.
Where Orbit studies balance under motion, Compression studies **essence under reduction**.

---

## Purpose

Use the Compression Lens when:
- a system feels complex or over-parameterized,
- multiple explanations exist,
- or you suspect hidden structure beneath surface variability.

---

## Forces

- **Inward force:** compression, minimal description, parsimony.
- **Outward force:** expressiveness, redundancy, flexibility.

Too much compression destroys meaning.
Too little compression hides it.

---

## Distance / Control Parameters

- Compression strength
- Description length budget
- Number of retained generators / features
- Allowed approximation error

This lens tunes *how aggressively* information is discarded.

---

## Stability Invariants

Quantities that should persist under healthy compression:

- core generators
- invariant statistics
- minimal counterexamples
- structural symmetries

If these disappear, compression is too strong.

---

## Failure Signals

- conclusions change wildly with small compression changes
- different compressions yield incompatible cores
- essential behavior vanishes early

These signal loss of meaning, not discovery.

---

## Reframing Moves

- project onto minimal generating sets
- replace objects with summaries
- identify equivalence classes
- measure description length explicitly

Change the question from:
> “Does this hold?”

to:
> “What cannot be compressed away?”

---

## Observation Test

A new observation under the Compression Lens:

- identifies a minimal invariant
- shows two phenomena compress to the same core
- proves a lower bound on description length

If compression clarifies rather than obscures, the lens is valid.

---

## Relation to Orbit

Orbit asks:
> Can this system persist under opposing forces?

Compression asks:
> What must exist for persistence to be possible at all?

Together, they form a cone of vision:
- Orbit controls *trajectory*
- Compression reveals *essence*

---

## Closing

Compression is not simplification.
It is respect for what cannot be removed.

*If it survives compression, it deserves explanation.*
