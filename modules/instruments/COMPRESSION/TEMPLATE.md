# Compression Lens — Template

## Purpose
- What is being clarified by compression?

## Forces
- Inward force (compression/parsimony):
- Outward force (expressiveness/redundancy):

## Distance / Control Parameters
- Compression knobs / budgets:

## Stability Invariants
- What should survive reduction?

## Failure Signals
- What changes mean we over-compressed?

## Reframing Moves
- What representation or generator set helps?

## Observation Test
- What new invariant / equivalence / lower bound would count?

## Notes
- (Optional) minimal core found:
