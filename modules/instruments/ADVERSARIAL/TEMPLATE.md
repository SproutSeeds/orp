# Adversarial Lens — Template

## Purpose
- What must be robust, and why?

## Forces
- Inward force (coherence/confidence):
- Outward force (attack/perturbation):

## Distance / Control Parameters
- Adversary strength / perturbation budget:

## Stability Invariants
- What should remain true under stress?

## Failure Signals
- What would count as a decisive break?

## Reframing Moves
- What counterexample or quantifier flip helps?

## Observation Test
- What new robustness bound or minimal counterexample would count?

## Notes
- (Optional) worst-case scenario:
