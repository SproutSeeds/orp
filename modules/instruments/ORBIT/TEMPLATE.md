## Forces
- Inward force (structure):
- Outward force (entropy):

## Extremes (Failure Modes)

- Too far (over-entropy):

## Distance (Orbit Radius)
- Tunable parameter(s) / knobs:

## Stability Invariant
- What stays bounded when healthy?

## Instability Signals
- What indicates collapse?

## Reframing (Change Coordinates)
- What frame-switch helps?

## Observation Test
- What would count as a new observation?

## Notes
- (Optional) predicted boundary / corridor:
