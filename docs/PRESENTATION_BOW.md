# ORP + Instruments — A Calm Introduction

> *A protocol for truth under pressure, with optional ways of seeing.*

This short document ties together ORP and Instruments for presentation. It is not exhaustive. It is meant to orient, reassure, and invite.

## What ORP Is

ORP (Open Research Protocol) governs **what happens after a claim is made**:

- claims must be explicit
- verification must be concrete
- failures are recorded, not hidden
- disagreement resolves by evidence, not argument

ORP is intentionally minimal. It does not tell you *what to think* or *how to explore*.

---

## Why Instruments Exist

Most disagreement begins **before** claims — at framing.

Instruments are optional, process-only tools that help choose a reference frame *before* making a claim. They influence questions, not outcomes.

- ORP governs truth
- Instruments explore reality

Verification is blind to instruments.

## The Relationship (One Glance)

Curiosity
↓
[ Instrument (optional) ]  →  predictions / focus
↓
Claim (ORP)
↓
Verification
↓
✓ Accepted  |  ✗ Downgraded / Failed (recorded)

You may enter at any point. Instruments are never required.

## The Initial Instrument Set

These instruments are **examples**, not requirements:

- **Orbit Lens** — persistence, balance, gradients, stability
- **Compression Lens** — essence, invariants, minimal description
- **Adversarial Lens** — failure modes, counterexamples, robustness

They are orthogonal. Use one, several, or none.

## How to Choose (or Not)

- If the problem feels unclear → try an instrument
- If the claim is obvious → skip instruments
- If framing helps → use it
- If it doesn’t → ignore it

ORP works either way.

---

## Invitation

If you notice a repeatable way of seeing that:
- reveals structure,
- generates predictions,
- or exposes failure modes,

that may be a new instrument.

Create it. Share it. Discard it if it fails.

ORP will still work.

## Closing

This system is designed to:
- reduce ego
- increase clarity
- preserve failed work
- allow multiple perspectives without multiple truths

It offers a place to stand, not a path to follow.

*Use what helps. Ignore the rest.*
